Project Description - 

Domain : eCommerce

Instacart is a grocery ordering and delivery app that aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. Instacartâ€™s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently, they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session.
The dataset is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders (limited data set added on Git Hu) from more than 200,000 Instacart users.

Below Key Solution Aspects needs to be coded (solution code attached) - 
1. Load all the data files into Spark DataFrame 
2. Merge all the data frames based on the common key and create a single DataFrame for below needs.
3. Check missing data for any null values on the key files
4. List the most ordered products from Instacart (top 10)
5. Check whether people usually reorder the same previous ordered products?
6. List most reordered products from Instacart (top 10) 
7. List the most important department and aisle (by number of products)
8. List the top 10 departments of Instacart
9. List the top 10 products ordered in the morning (6 AM to 11 AM)

Please feel free to use this sample set/questions list and improvise it further
